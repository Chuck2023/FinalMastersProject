            <p>Abraham Mensah, a 48-year-old teak farmer in Tekyire, felt cheated when the government seized his 5-acre plantation in July 2022. Tekyire is one of the five communities impacted by Newmont's expansion plans. </p>

            <p>Mensah was one of 250 farmers who refused Newmont's compensation offer. The opposition escalated in 2023 when farmers, including Mensah, confronted Newmont workers drilling on his property. </p>

            <p>Newmont apologized publicly, admitting the drilling was a "mistake" and that Mensah's farm wasn't designated for mining. Yet, two months later, Mensah received notice of a forced acquisition by the State. </p>            
            
            <p>“I felt like a slave in my land,” Mensah responded to the government's forced acquisition. “Newmont was prioritized over me, a citizen.”</p>

            <p>Mensah's plight is not unique. </p>

            <p>An investigation into the expansion of Newmont– the world’s largest gold miner, according to Bloomberg– has revealed a series of allegations that include unfair compensation for the acquisition of residents’ farms, unfair representation during committee hearings, and threats of intimidation and violence by local farmers who say their livelihoods are on the verge of collapsing before them. Since 2017, Ghana’s Ahafo North region locals have accused Newmont Corp. of taking over their farmlands without notice or fair compensation.</p>

            <p>Mining in Akyaa’s Ahafo North region mine, which has grown by 10,000 acres, has resulted in the removal of hundreds of cocoa trees – trees the crop farmers depend on. Laws mandate that mining companies reimburse farmers for the value of their land. Still, residents say that instead of being compensated for the entire lifetime worth of their land, they were only given a check to cover a single season.</p>

            <p>Ghana is Africa's second-largest gold producer, generating about 90 percent of the country's total exports. According to financial and economic data published by the Bank of Ghana in 2024, the country's gold export receipts rose by US$431 million in the first half of 2023. Because of that, Ghana's rich gold mines and other mineral fields have attracted leading global mining companies to the country's mineral reserves </p>

            <p>Now, on the ground, there is a battle for land with farmers like Mensah striving to protect their land under laws that are only loosely enforced by a government–and chiefs–that seem intent on protecting Newmont’s profits above all else. </p>

            <p>Before breaking ground in Ahafo North in 2017, Representatives from Newmont’s Ghana office, including its external affairs manager, Samuel Osei, met with leaders and farmers from five communities affected by their planned expansion between 2009 and 2011. The company made two key promises: fair compensation for lost farmland and prioritizing locals for new jobs. </p>

            <p>The plan was met with praise. </p>

            <p>"We believed Newmont would improve our lives financially, " said Kwabena Fosu, a 48-year-old farmer impacted by the project. “I thought they'd follow the laws and give us fair compensation." </p>

            <p>By the end of 2017, the American mining powerhouse secured a mining lease from Ghana’s Securities and Exchange Commission and announced the construction of its largest surface mine in Africa. </p>

            <p>The total investment capital for the Ahafo North gold mine in Ghana is $750 million, with a mine life of 13 years.  Newmont's 2023 forecast to investors called the Ahafo mine “the best-unmined gold deposit” in West Africa, estimating about seven million ounces of gold. </p>

            <h2 class="text-center my-5">The Compensation Comittee</h2>
            
            <p>Ghanaian law requires mining companies to obtain a license and offer "fair and adequate" compensation to affected landowners like Akyaa. The country’s land laws give landowners the right to their properties; however, these privileges are waived when the government issues a mineral permit for mining activities. In this case, companies must negotiate with affected landowners for fair compensation. <P>

            <p>Newmont set up a compensation committee–a standard practice in any new country–to negotiate fair compensation with affected farmers. Yet, interviews with 21 farmer representatives paint a different picture. They said the committee wasn't transparent. Farmers felt silenced and unable to seek outside help, including talking to the media. </p>

            <p>The committee included representation from farmers, traditional rulers, the government, and the company. However, residents allege the company’s drafting of the committee’s rules and regulations suggested dominance and a culture of silence in the negotiation process. </p>

            <p>Publishers, owners, and other corporate executives, especially advertising sales executives, could try to use their powers over journalists to influence how news is reported and published. For this reason, journalists traditionally relied on top management to create and maintain a "firewall" between the news and other departments in a news organization to prevent undue influence on the news department.</p>

            <p>Farmers said the committee was stacked against them in Newmont's favor. Under its rules, set by Newmont, the company has veto power over committee leadership and enjoys a larger voting majority. Additionally, farmers are restricted from recording proceedings or sharing information with the media. </p>

            <p>Despite the company’s initial promise of fair compensation, locals lost faith. </p>

            <p>“I saw several Newmont officials, chiefs, community elders, and farmers. It was a packed meeting,” said 45-year-old Comfort Akyaa, a cocoa farmer who reluctantly attended, seeking answers. “We chanted, ‘We wanted our farms back." </p>

            <p>John Mensah sat on the committee. </p>

            <p>After three years of helping draft the guidelines, the 55-year-old teak farmer was the first local to resign. </p>

            <p>“I felt I was letting down my people,” Mensah said. “It didn’t feel right. The negotiation committee only cares for the company’s interests, not ours.” </p>

            <p>“It was a rubber stamp,” said Abraham Mensah, an affected farmer who resigned from the committee in 2010, joining John Mensah in forming a farmer group to reject Newmont’s compensation offer. “The company took hold of all proceedings and negotiations.” </p> 

            <p>Farmers alleged that Newmont only covered the value of one month's crops, not the long-term value of the lost farmland. </p>

            <p>In 2023, a spokesperson for Newmont Africa said that the committee had delivered on its promise and "adequately compensated" 2,500 people. </p>


            <h2 class="text-center my-5">Affected Farmers</h2>

            <p>In May 2021, Ghanaian cocoa farmer Comfort Akyaa, 45, sprinted towards her 5-acre farm at Tekyire, a farming community in the country's Ahafo North region. Panic fueled her steps—two excavators loomed, and three men measured her land. These men were land valuers contracted by Newmont Corporation, a Colorado, U.S.-based mining company with holdings on our four continents, to assess the value of plants and crops before taking control of the land. "They said the land was now under Newmont," she said, “I was ordered to go home and never return to it or face the consequences." </p> 

            <p>The pregnant mother of four recalled her heart racing as she interrogated the men. Before a mining company acquires a farmer’s land, Ghana's mining laws mandate that companies engage affected farmers in valuing their land. Akyaa denied ever meeting an official from the company before her land valuation. </p>

            <p>In July 2021, after Akyaa’s encounter with the unknown men, she received a call inviting her to attend a community hearing organized by Newmont. The agenda was related to how Newmont would compensate these farmers. </p>

            <p>Initially, Akyaa refused to attend the meeting but showed up, desperate for answers. </p> 

            <p>Akyaa’s farm stretches across five acres. She checks her cocoa trees daily for signs of infections, theft, and optimal humidity levels. </p>

            <p>Her income from cocoa farming is critical for her family's well-being. With a fifth child, she relies on her trees for utilities, groceries, and healthcare when government health is insufficient. </p>

            <p>On this day, Newmont handed each farmer a letter stating how much they would receive for their destroyed crops. </p>

            <p>Newmont told Akyaa her farm was worth $7,700. </p>

            <p>The one-time payment was only for her cocoa crops and did not include the price of the farm. According to a coalition of affected farmers named Concerned Farmers Association, a fair price, including the land and revenue generated by the crops over a lifetime, would be estimated at least $150,000. </p>

            <p>Receipts issued by Newmont workers to some affected Ahafo North farmers indicate that the corporation paid for the present value and not the lifetime of damaged crops. </p>

            <p>“I was cheated,” Comfort said. She said she had no choice but to accept the offer but feared fighting for what she deserved. “They are powerful; I’m just a woman and a farmer.” </p>

            <p>Newmont sought to limit its long-term financial obligations through a contract prepared for affected farmers. This contract aimed to have farmers waive any legal right to seek compensation that reflects the lifetime value of their lost crops. In a revealing excerpt, the "letter of undertaking" signed by Samuel Darko, an affected farmer, states: </p>

            <p>"I understand that this is a gesture by Newmont in recognition of the start of the Ahafo North Project but does not set a precedent for the future... I hereby sign this letter of undertaking that I will not hold Newmont liable for interest payment if Newmont is not able to pay my "top-up" within the specified 90-day period as per Regulation 4 of Minerals and Mining (Compensation and Resettlement) Regulations, 2012 (L.I. 2175), as it is not my entitled compensation but a "top-up" payment." </p>

            <p>Akyaa, who couldn’t read or understand the contract that effectively took her farm away, signed anyway. </p>
