            <p>Abraham Mensah, a 48-year-old teak farmer in Tekyire, felt cheated when the government seized his 5-acre plantation in July 2022. Tekyire is one of the five communities impacted by Newmont's expansion plans. </p>

            <p>Mensah was one of 250 farmers who refused Newmont's compensation offer. The opposition escalated in 2023 when farmers, including Mensah, confronted Newmont workers drilling on his property. </p>

            <p>Newmont apologized publicly, admitting the drilling was a "mistake" and that Mensah's farm wasn't designated for mining. Yet, two months later, Mensah received notice of a forced acquisition by the State. </p>            
            
            <p>“I felt like a slave in my land,” Mensah responded to the government's forced acquisition. “Newmont was prioritized over me, a citizen.”</p>

            <p>Mensah's plight is not unique. </p>

            <p>An investigation into the expansion of Newmont– the world’s largest gold miner, according to Bloomberg– has revealed a series of allegations that include unfair compensation for the acquisition of residents’ farms, unfair representation during committee hearings, and threats of intimidation and violence by local farmers who say their livelihoods are on the verge of collapsing before them. Since 2017, Ghana’s Ahafo North region locals have accused Newmont Corp. of taking over their farmlands without notice or fair compensation.</p>

            <p>Mining in Akyaa’s Ahafo North region mine, which has grown by 10,000 acres, has resulted in the removal of hundreds of cocoa trees – trees the crop farmers depend on. Laws mandate that mining companies reimburse farmers for the value of their land. Still, residents say that instead of being compensated for the entire lifetime worth of their land, they were only given a check to cover a single season.</p>

            <p>Ghana is Africa's second-largest gold producer, generating about 90 percent of the country's total exports. According to financial and economic data published by the Bank of Ghana in 2024, the country's gold export receipts rose by US$431 million in the first half of 2023. Because of that, Ghana's rich gold mines and other mineral fields have attracted leading global mining companies to the country's mineral reserves </p>

            <p>Now, on the ground, there is a battle for land with farmers like Mensah striving to protect their land under laws that are only loosely enforced by a government–and chiefs–that seem intent on protecting Newmont’s profits above all else. </p>

            <p>Before breaking ground in Ahafo North in 2017, Representatives from Newmont’s Ghana office, including its external affairs manager, Samuel Osei, met with leaders and farmers from five communities affected by their planned expansion between 2009 and 2011. The company made two key promises: fair compensation for lost farmland and prioritizing locals for new jobs. </p>

            <p>By the end of 2017, the American mining powerhouse secured a mining lease from Ghana’s Securities and Exchange Commission and announced the construction of its largest surface mine in Africa. </p>

            <p>The total investment capital for the Ahafo North gold mine in Ghana is $750 million, with a mine life of 13 years.

            <h2 class="text-center my-5">The Compensation Comittee</h2>
            
            <p>Ghanaian law requires mining companies to obtain a license and offer "fair and adequate" compensation to affected landowners like Akyaa. The country’s land laws give landowners the right to their properties; however, these privileges are waived when the government issues a mineral permit for mining activities. In this case, companies must negotiate with affected landowners for fair compensation. <P>

            <p>Newmont set up a compensation committee–a standard practice in any new country–to negotiate fair compensation with affected farmers. Yet, interviews with 21 farmer representatives paint a different picture. They said the committee wasn't transparent. Farmers felt silenced and unable to seek outside help, including talking to the media. </p>

            <p>The committee included representation from farmers, traditional rulers, the government, and the company. However, residents allege the company’s drafting of the committee’s rules and regulations suggested dominance and a culture of silence in the negotiation process. </p>

            <p>Publishers, owners, and other corporate executives, especially advertising sales executives, could try to use their powers over journalists to influence how news is reported and published. For this reason, journalists traditionally relied on top management to create and maintain a "firewall" between the news and other departments in a news organization to prevent undue influence on the news department.</p>

            <p>Farmers said the committee was stacked against them in Newmont's favor. Under its rules, set by Newmont, the company has veto power over committee leadership and enjoys a larger voting majority. Additionally, farmers are restricted from recording proceedings or sharing information with the media. </p>

            <p>Despite the company’s initial promise of fair compensation, locals lost faith. </p>

            <p>“I saw several Newmont officials, chiefs, community elders, and farmers. It was a packed meeting,” said 45-year-old Comfort Akyaa, a cocoa farmer who reluctantly attended, seeking answers. “We chanted, ‘We wanted our farms back." </p>

            <p>John Mensah sat on the committee. </p>

            <p>After three years of helping draft the guidelines, the 55-year-old teak farmer was the first local to resign. </p>

            <p>“I felt I was letting down my people,” Mensah said. “It didn’t feel right. The negotiation committee only cares for the company’s interests, not ours.” </p>

            <p>“It was a rubber stamp,” said Abraham Mensah, an affected farmer who resigned from the committee in 2010, joining John Mensah in forming a farmer group to reject Newmont’s compensation offer. “The company took hold of all proceedings and negotiations.” </p> 

            <p>Farmers alleged that Newmont only covered the value of one month's crops, not the long-term value of the lost farmland. </p>

            <p>In 2023, a spokesperson for Newmont Africa said that the committee had delivered on its promise and "adequately compensated" 2,500 people. </p>


            <h2 class="text-center my-5">Affected Farmers</h2>

            <p>In May 2021, Ghanaian cocoa farmer Comfort Akyaa, 45, sprinted towards her 5-acre farm at Tekyire, a farming community in the country's Ahafo North region. Panic fueled her steps—two excavators loomed, and three men measured her land. These men were land valuers contracted by Newmont Corporation, a Colorado, U.S.-based mining company with holdings on our four continents, to assess the value of plants and crops before taking control of the land. "They said the land was now under Newmont," she said, “I was ordered to go home and never return to it or face the consequences." </p> 

            <p>The pregnant mother of four recalled her heart racing as she interrogated the men. Before a mining company acquires a farmer’s land, Ghana's mining laws mandate that companies engage affected farmers in valuing their land. Akyaa denied ever meeting an official from the company before her land valuation. </p>

            <p>In July 2021, after Akyaa’s encounter with the unknown men, she received a call inviting her to attend a community hearing organized by Newmont. The agenda was related to how Newmont would compensate these farmers. </p>

            <p>Initially, Akyaa refused to attend the meeting but showed up, desperate for answers. </p> 

            <p>Akyaa’s farm stretches across five acres. She checks her cocoa trees daily for signs of infections, theft, and optimal humidity levels. </p>

            <p>Her income from cocoa farming is critical for her family's well-being. With a fifth child, she relies on her trees for utilities, groceries, and healthcare when government health is insufficient. </p>

            <p>On this day, Newmont handed each farmer a letter stating how much they would receive for their destroyed crops. </p>

            <p>Newmont told Akyaa her farm was worth $7,700. </p>

            <p>The one-time payment was only for her cocoa crops and did not include the price of the farm. According to a coalition of affected farmers named Concerned Farmers Association, a fair price, including the land and revenue generated by the crops over a lifetime, would be estimated at least $150,000. </p>

            <p>Receipts issued by Newmont workers to some affected Ahafo North farmers indicate that the corporation paid for the present value and not the lifetime of damaged crops. </p>

            <p>“I was cheated,” Comfort said. She said she had no choice but to accept the offer but feared fighting for what she deserved. “They are powerful; I’m just a woman and a farmer.” </p>

            <p>Newmont sought to limit its long-term financial obligations through a contract prepared for affected farmers. This contract aimed to have farmers waive any legal right to seek compensation that reflects the lifetime value of their lost crops. In a revealing excerpt, the "letter of undertaking" signed by Samuel Darko, an affected farmer, states: </p>

            <p>"I understand that this is a gesture by Newmont in recognition of the start of the Ahafo North Project but does not set a precedent for the future... I hereby sign this letter of undertaking that I will not hold Newmont liable for interest payment if Newmont is not able to pay my "top-up" within the specified 90-day period as per Regulation 4 of Minerals and Mining (Compensation and Resettlement) Regulations, 2012 (L.I. 2175), as it is not my entitled compensation but a "top-up" payment." </p>

            <p>Akyaa, who couldn’t read or understand the contract that effectively took her farm away, signed anyway. </p>

            <h2 class="text-center my-5">Ghana's Laws</h2>
         
            
            <p>The State weakens the ability of farmers to obtain fair compensation. </p>

            <p>Mining laws unfairly place the burden of negotiation on individual farmers who are disadvantaged against well-resourced mining companies like Newmont. This imbalance creates an uneven playing field in negotiations, where mining companies with deep pockets hold all the cards compared to destitute affected farmers, said a representative from Wacam– a community-based human rights and environmental mining nonprofit in Ghana, helping farmers like Akya demand their rights to fair compensation. </p>

            <p>In 2012, Ghana's government issued regulations (Minerals and Mining (Compensation and Resettlement) Regulations, 2012) that provided legal backing for mining companies to set their compensation committees. </p>

            <p>“This law weakens the bargaining power of the farmers,” said Kwaku Afari, a technical director of Wacam who represented over 100 farmers on a court case that stopped Newmont from evicting them from their farms in 2021. “It favors Newmont.” </p>

            <p>Also, the current legal framework undermines farmers' control over their land. Since the government holds the ultimate power to grant mining licenses, farmers have no choice but to negotiate with mining companies, even if they oppose the project. In cases when farmers rejected offers, the government intervened and forcibly acquired their lands in Newmont’s favor. </p>

            <p>Newmont's financial muscle in Ghana is undeniable. In the first three months of 2023, their Ghana mines (Akyem and Ahafo South) paid the government $237 million (converted from GHS 842.72 million) in taxes, royalties, and levies. This amount dwarfs the 2023 first-quarter GDP contribution of Ghana's oil and gas sectors, which stood at a mere $3.7 million. </p>

            <p>Experts argue that Ghana's dependence on such revenue creates a conflict of interest. Enforcing fair compensation regulations for affected farmers is less important than maintaining the presence of large corporations like Newmont in the country. </p>

              <h2 class="text-center my-5">The Resistance</h2>   

            <p>In 2022, Farmers affected by the Ahafo North expansion project formed the "Concerned Farmers Association," led by 55-year-old John Mensah, a month after he resigned from Newmont's crop compensation committee. </p>

            <p>Partnering with the WACAM, the association collectively rejected all compensation offers from Newmont. WACAM's lawyers work closely with affected communities, gathering evidence and building solid legal cases to challenge Newmont's actions in Ghana’s court system. Kwaku Afari, WACAM's technical director, said his organization remains the farmers' only lifeline to fair compensation. </p>

            <p>Partnering with the WACAM, the association collectively rejected all compensation offers from Newmont. </p>

            <p>WACAM's lawyers work closely with affected communities, gathering evidence and building solid legal cases to challenge Newmont's actions in Ghana’s court system. Kwaku Afari, WACAM's technical director, said his organization remains the farmers' only lifeline to fair compensation. </p> 

            <p>"Farmers mandated us to lead them in land negotiations," Afari said. "They remain steadfast in not allowing the company on their land until proper legal procedures are followed. Their farms are still intact." </p>

            <p>Afari's organization represented 100 farmers in court in 2022. In a recent case against Newmont in 2021, the lawyer secured a court injunction against Newmont's land grab of about 100 farmers. </p>

            <p>As a result, Afari said despite this victory, the government of Ghana, together with Newmont, proceeded with the forced acquisition of some selected farmers totaling 350 despite the ruling - a move Afari described as arbitrary to the country's mining laws. </p>

            <p>The group has mobilized farmers, held press conferences, and petitioned Ghana's parliament to challenge Newmont's land acquisition and compensation process. </p>
            
            <p>Over 300 farmers petitioned Parliament in May 2022, claiming Newmont's Ahafo North Project would displace around 20,000 farmers across five communities. Farmers argue compensation won't offset the project's severe impacts. </p>

            <p>Also, farmers' lawyers demanded Newmont stop destroying teak plantations, cocoa farms, and fish ponds. They stressed that while government acquisition procedures are underway, land has yet to be legally acquired for mining. "Our clients will use all legal means to protect their properties," Wacam’s lawyers stated in a letter to the Newmont’s Ahafo Mines Director dated 16th August 2023. Newmont has not responded to their concerns and is still taking land for mine expansion. </p>

            <h2 class="text-center my-5">Intimidation and Violence</h2>          

            <p>Farmers and lawyers from WACAM say Newmont and its associates use threats and force to seize land, violating Ghanaian law and international human rights standards. </p>

            <p>Ahmed Mensah, who worked his 10-acre plantation for 30 years harvesting teak trees, said he woke up one morning to find security agents on his farm. Abraham said the guards instructed him to leave and never return to his farm. </p>

            <p>“I was scared,” he said. “I chose my life over the farm." </p>


            <p>In October 2023, OXFAM USA and Ghanaian organizations WACAM and CEPIL, in a petition to Ghana’s parliament, alleged a pattern of intimidation against farmers resisting Newmont's compensation offers. 

A coalition of farmers, backed by WACAM and CEPIL, released a timeline of intimidation and violence that occurred during Newmont’s expansion in the area. </p>   

            <h2 class="text-center my-5">Incidents Involving Newmont:</h2>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>August 20, 2017:</strong> A group of individuals, allegedly acting in Newmont's interest, disrupted a rights awareness forum for affected farmers in Terchire. Adusah Yakubu, a WACAM volunteer invited by the community, was assaulted during the attack. </li>
    
              <li><strong>February 10, 2020:</strong> Nana Okoh Agyemang II, a former chief of Terchire, summoned members of the Concerned Farmers Association, warning them against refusing Newmont's compensation offer. </li> 
              
              <li><strong>March 15, 2021:</strong> An armed group representing Newmont interests threatened to burn CEPIL's vehicle while disrupting a rights awareness meeting. Organizers canceled the event. </li>

              <li><strong>November 2021:</strong> State security personnel detained two farmers--Stanely Tamakloe and Joseph Bonsu--for leading a protest against what they deemed an unlawful property enumeration process by Newmont. </li>

              <li>strong>October 6, 2022:</strong> Newmont-aligned youth group reportedly destroyed poultry farms belonging to Yaw Asare and Abraham Mensa, both leaders in the Concerned Farmers Association. Both farmers said the act was an attempt by the mining company to intimidate them into relinquishing their lands. </li>
              
              <li><strong>March 10, 2023:</strong> A district official blocked a Wacam and CEPIL survey at Newmont's Akyem project, labeling them fraudsters and issuing threats. The official allegedly ordered them to leave the community, stating he could not guarantee their safety.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When asked about the list, Newmont denies all accusations. </p>

             <h2 class="text-center my-5">The Helplessness of Local Chiefs--"If We Had Power"</h2>

            <p>Nana Yeboah Asuhene, a sub-chief in Taakyire, a village of 2,500 farmers in Ahafo North, faces imminent demolition of his home to make way for Newmont's mine. </p> 
            <p>"If we had the power, we would ask them to leave our lands, but we don't," Asuhene said.
He fears the future of his village’s farmers, most of whom lack formal education. "Farming is all they know," he said. </p>

            <p>The influence of Newmont is evident at the palace of Afirisipa Chief IV Nana Obohini Nkrawiri, chief of Takyire-- located a mile away from Nana Yeboah Asuhene's home. </p>

            <p>His residence, displaying signs of recent development, was refurbished by Newmont and had the company's tractors on its compound. </p>

            <p>Chief Nkrawiri refused an interview, citing a need to gain permission from the mining company and worries about "trouble" from "powers above." </p>

            <p>On January 23, 2023, chiefs from Ahafo and local government officials organized a meeting to seek the approval of concerned farmers to represent them in their engagement with Newmont. The farmers declined the proposal, preferring CEPIL and WACAM. </p>

            <p>A series of attacks against the nonprofits followed. </p>
            
            <p>In a media interview on February 1, 2023, some chiefs from Tano North, represented by a coalition of youth groups from all five affected communities in Ahafo North, blamed Wacam for supporting the group's resistance to the Newmont Ahafo Project even when the chiefs had agreed to the project. </p>

            <p>"The coalition and the chiefs will confront Wacam and their anti-mining ideology head-on," a spokesperson for the coalition of Ahafo North Youth, Richard Adae Yeboah, who also represents the chiefs, said in a press statement on February 6, 2023. “We are therefore asking Wacam to unconditionally cease all operations in our five communities!" </p>
            
            <p>During a visit to the Ahafo North Project site in July 2023, Freda Prempeh, a member of parliament for Tano North—the constituency where Newmont is constructing the Ahafo North mine—assured farmers of her effort to ensure compensation packages for them from Newmont. </p>

            <p>" As an M.P., I would not be unconcerned if the Mine cheated you," she said. “I know the mine has taken over your significant sources of livelihood, and you must also receive adequate compensation to better your lives," she told a local news wire, Ghana News Agency (GNA). </p>

            <p>Yet farmers described her visit and assurance as "performative.” </p>

            <p>“She just came for the cameras,” said John Mensah, who watched her visit on television with members of his Association of Affected Farmers. “Farmers are still fighting for fair compensation.” </p>

            <p>Also, the state's Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources—which oversees mining activities in the country — has yet to respond to farmers' concerns. </p>

            <p>Despite an eviction notice, Ahmed Saed holds on to his 15-acre farm, the last remnant from his ancestors. 
In 2022, Newmont razed his teak farm and nine fish ponds, falsely labeling the 61-year-old a squatter. </p>

            <p>This land sustains not just Saed but a small village of 30 residents. </p>

            <p>"This is all we've got," he said, pointing to their homes. </p>

            <p>Newmont's acquired farms encircle Ahmed's land. The farmer, who has worked his cocoa, teak farms, and fish ponds for two decades, travels through security checkposts and guards daily to access the main village. </p>

            <p>"I'm met with guards — sometimes armed — heavy machinery and dust," the 61-year-old farmer who recently joined the Concerned Farmers Association said. "But that can't deter me." </p>

            <p>By 2024, Newmont expects to have cleared all contested lands, paving the way for the mine's construction by 2025 and subsequent operationalization in 2026. The government continues confiscating farmers' land who oppose the company's compensation offer. </p>

            <p>"We are putting up a strong case in court," a WACAM representative said. "These farmers will get the justice they deserve." </p>
