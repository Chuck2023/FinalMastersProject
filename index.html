            <p>From above, a gash scars the 25,000-acre lush landscape of five farming communities. This is the Ahafo North Project, a $850 million gold mine in Ghana by the US-based gold mining giant, Newmont. The ambitious project aims to extract between 270,000 to 325,000 ounces of gold annually.</p>

            <p>Yet, beneath the surface of this venture lies a disturbing narrative. Affected farmers share accounts of injustice - unfair compensation, intimidation, and violence. </p>

            <p>On a dry and humid Saturday morning, Beatrice Adu works her cocoa farm. With mouths to feed and bills to pay, the 45-year old farmer, single mother and grandmother checks for any dark spots on the freshly sprouting cocoa sprouts floating peacefully on sheds of cocoa trees scattered around her 4-acre farm. Beatrice is confident of holding her family together once she sells a year’s harvest to a government cocoa regulatory agency – earning at least $400 for this crop season. </p>

            <p>“We need the money,” she said, wiping the sweat off her brow as she rested her aching back on the bark of one matured cocoa tree.</p>

            <p>Beatrice’s cocoa farm, along with hundreds of other farms in Ghana’s Ahafo North region, is a breadbasket for millions of farming households across West Africa. The farms are also a strong supply of the country’s global cocoa exports, the Food and Agriculture said. However, things changed in 2018 when the presence of a mining company in the region changed the fortunes of over a hundred farmers, including Beatrice. </p>

            <p>In May 2022, Beatrice spotted two tipper trucks a mile away as she approached her farm on a red-clay, dusty street. As she approached her farm gate, she noticed the heavy-duty machines were on her farm. In a rush of adrenaline, the 45-year-old confronted three middle-aged men in green reflectors and hard hats she recalled valuing her land.</p>

            <p>Upon interrogation, Beatrice said she was told to vacate her farm never to return, else face the consequences. These men, Beatrice said, all had Newmont T-shirts on. Under surface mining rights and compensation in Ghana’s minerals and mining Act, land valuations by a mining company shall be conducted “in the presence of the owner or lawful occupier of land and an officer of the government agency responsible for land valuation”. Yet, Beatrice had no government representation in the valuation process.</p>

            <p>“They said it’s orders from above,” Beatrice said. “I felt helpless and overpowered, I left.” Two weeks have passed since her encounter. Still in unbelief, Beatrice consulted with neighbors on the best steps to reclaim her land and livelihood. It was then she realized she was not alone, several other farmers like her had received a similar instruction - to stop working their farm.</p>

            <p>Newmont requested a meeting with Beatrice and about a hundred other farmers in July 2022. The purpose? To pay compensation for affected farms. Ghana’s Minerals and Mining Compensation laws says companies must enter agreements with affected farmers on compensation. Beatrice said no such agreement was reached with her.</p>

            <p>However, a spokesperson for the company said an agreement was reached through a compensation committee that included representatives from the affected farmers, the government and Newmont.</p>

          <div class="col-12 col-md-8 col-lg-6">

            <p>Receipts from some affected farmers show the mining company only paid for the value and not the lifetime of the damaged crops. In the case of Beatrice, she received $7,700 USD as a lifetime payment for her cocoa crops. No compensation was made for the loss of land, whose value had reduced from 4 acres to 3.5 after Newmont’s valuation.</p>

            <p>Beatrice felt shortchanged. In Ghana, cocoa farmers receive a farmgate price of about $USD1,821 from the government each cocoa crop season for every ton of beans harvested. She felt her compensation could only sustain herself and family for at least 7 years.</p>

            <p>“We are desperate and destitute.We no longer have a livelihood,” Beatrice said. “Newmont’s compensation is not okay.”</p>

            <p>Newmont in a press statement said affected farmers were compensated through a fair and transparent negotiation committee set up in agreement with involved parties.</p>

            <p>Still, records obtained from affected farmers and their lawyers prove the US-based mining company repeatedly failed to pay even what it promised, leaving farmers like Beatrice destitute.</p>

            <p>On May 4, 2022, a coalition of 150 farmers presented a letter to Ghana’s law-making body called Parliament. The coalition calling itself “Affected Farmers Association” accused Newmont of refusing to make payments to farmers they unilaterally categorize as “squatters” even though those farmers have a clear history of having worked their land for years and years.<P>
            <p>In September 2017, Newmont declared the Ahafo North area a “Mining Area” to access land and legally build safety zones around the mine. At a December 2019 hearing, they assured locals that this declaration “doesn’t prevent farming or other work” and there’s no set date when those activities would stop.</p>

            <p>A news organization's budget inevitably reflects decision-making about what news to cover, for what audience, and in what depth. When budgets are cut, editors may sacrifice reporters in distant news bureaus, reduce the number of staff assigned to low-income areas, or wipe entire communities from the publication's zone of interest.</p>

            <p>Publishers, owners and other corporate executives, especially advertising sales executives, could try to use their powers over journalists to influence how news is reported and published. For this reason, journalists traditionally relied on top management to create and maintain a "firewall" between the news and other departments in a news organization to prevent undue influence on the news department.</p>

            <p>Starting in the 1940s, United States broadcast television channels would air 10-to-15-minute segments of news programming one or two times per evening. The era of live-TV news coverage would begin in the 1960s with the assassination of John F. Kennedy, broadcast and reported to live on a variety of nationally syndicated television channels. During the 60s and 70s, television channels would begin adding regular morning or midday news shows. Starting in 1980 with the establishment of CNN, news channels began providing 24-hour news coverage, a format which persists through today.</p>

            <p>It's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well. That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.</p>
            
            <p>A news organization's budget inevitably reflects decision-making about what news to cover, for what audience, and in what depth. When budgets are cut, editors may sacrifice reporters in distant news bureaus, reduce the number of staff assigned to low-income areas, or wipe entire communities from the publication's zone of interest.</p>

            <p>Publishers, owners and other corporate executives, especially advertising sales executives, could try to use their powers over journalists to influence how news is reported and published. For this reason, journalists traditionally relied on top management to create and maintain a "firewall" between the news and other departments in a news organization to prevent undue influence on the news department.</p>

            <p>While publications reporting the news to the general public in a standardized fashion only began to appear in the 17th century and later, governments as early as Han dynasty China made use of regularly published news bulletins. These bulletins, however, were intended only for government officials, and thus were not journalistic news publications in the modern sense of the term.</p>

            <p>Starting in the 1940s, United States broadcast television channels would air 10-to-15-minute segments of news programming one or two times per evening. The era of live-TV news coverage would begin in the 1960s with the assassination of John F. Kennedy, broadcast and reported to live on a variety of nationally syndicated television channels. During the 60s and 70s, television channels would begin adding regular morning or midday news shows. Starting in 1980 with the establishment of CNN, news channels began providing 24-hour news coverage, a format which persists through today.</p>
